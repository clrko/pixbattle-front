# Pixbattle
ðŸ‘‰[The app is live here](https://pixbattle.com/) ðŸ‘ˆ 

**Pixbattle** is a responsive web application which allow any user to set up a photo contest with a group of his choice (family, friends, colleagues etc.).

The idea was found during the coronavirus crisis by Maxime Parola, our client, who wanted to find a way to maintain social ties despite the lockdown. 

The principle of the game is for a user to create a group by inviting some friends or family members and organise a photo contest on a particular topic. 

Each member has to upload a picture and in the end, after discovering all the pictures, will have to vote for his favorite ones. The winner will choose the theme of the next contest.
